## The Theme
The theme this year was 'Confucius Quotes'. Confucius is a Chinese teacher and philosopher 
in Chinese times, and many of his quotes have inspired people the world over. 

The idea of Confucius being a teacher is the main spark of innovation for this game. Confucius 
quotes are often inspirational and motivational, while also reminding a person to be humble. 
My game takes this idea of teaching, and applies the metaphors in a more literal sense. 
It starts by telling the user to open their mind, and not be ignorant of the world around them. 
Each level thereafter portrays a new angle in life such as control or the importance of memory. 
As the player progresses through the game, they gain additional knowledge and thus became less ignorant.

## How To: Set up
This is a javascript based game, and thus very simple to setup and play.
1. Download the files
2. Open any modern day browser that allows the use of Javascript
3. Open the index.html file in the browser
4. Let the games begin...

## Controls
To navigate between the different levels, make use of the mouse to click on actionable text. 
Actionable text will be found between [[ and ]] brackets.

### Level 1:
To play level 1, make use of the up and down arrow keys on a keyboard.
Pressing the up key decreases your speed, while pressing the down key increases your speed.
Be careful not to stop moving!

### Level 2:
To play level 2, watch the characters as they appear on the screen. Once it's your turn to input 
the numbers, enter the number then hit enter.

## Brief Description:
Confucius has offered insight and advice to people everywhere. Confucius quotes are inspirational, 
motivational, and can improve anyones life. This game teaches you to appreciate these sayings, where 
the only way to proceed is by truly understanding the meaning of his quotes.

## FAQ:
There are two 'levels' to this game. The first requires you to get your character down to the bottom of the 
screen using the up and down keys. The second requires you to remember which tile your character was in.
If you get stuck in any of these, refreshing the page will start a new round of the game. Optionally, you can 
also change the URL at the top of the page so that it loads a different step. These url 'cheats' are provided:
index.html --> the main starting page

game.html --> level 1
intro2.html --> explains how to play level 2

theend.html --> congratulations, you passed!

### Possible Bugs:
This game was specifically tested on a MacBook Pro. It's possible that some of the javascript measurements are off.

## Where's the sound?
Confucius says 'silence is a source of great strength'. With silence, you can understand better.
